Day of the Week
Write a program which takes a date in day/month/year format (e.g. 25/11/2015) and, if the date is valid, then it presents the date in, for example, “Wednesday, 25th November 2015” format.
 
You must write and make use of at least the following functions:
numberEnding() which takes a day number returns “th”, “st”, “nd” or “rd”.
monthName() which takes a month number (1-12) and return “January”, or “February”, …
dayOfTheWeek() which takes a day, month and year and returns “Monday”, or “Tuesday”, …
The day of the week function should use the Gaussian algorithm…
w = (day + floor(2.6 * (((month + 9) % 12) + 1) - 0.2) + y + floor(y/4) + floor(c/4) - 2c) mod 7
where
 Y: year-1 for January or February,
  year for the rest of the year
 y: last 2 digits of Y
 c: first 2 digits of Y
 w: day of week (0=Sunday,..6=Saturday)
  mod 7 needs to return a positive number (even if the
  passed value is negative.
NOTE:  You may incorporate functions from code provided to you within this course but must give appropriate credit.
